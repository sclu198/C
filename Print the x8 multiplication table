Question:
Your friend is having a lot of difficulties with multiplication tables. 
He's having the most trouble with the multiples of 8 table, and asks you to send him the multiples of 8 table so that he can learn it more easily. 
To do this, you decide to write a program that prints the multiples of 8 table. 
Because you will use your code again in the future to print other multiplcation tables, you decide to use a loop and only one print statement.

Your program must use the following format to print the multiples of 8 table (be careful with spaces):

0x8 = 0
1x8 = 8
...
10x8 = 80

Warning: Your program will not be reusable in the near future if you don't use a loop. 
         You must use a loop to print the multiplication table.




Source Code:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int i;
    int column1 = 0;
    int column3 = 0;
    for(i=0; i<=10; i++){
        printf("%dx8 = %d\n", column1, column3);
        column1 = column1 + 1;
        column3 = column3 + 8;
    }
    return 0;
}

/*
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int i, num, times;
    num = 8;
    times = 0;
    for(i=0; i<11; i++){
        printf("%dx%d = %d\n", times, num, times*num);
        times = times + 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

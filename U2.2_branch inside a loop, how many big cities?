Unit 2.2

Question:
You want to determine the number of cities in a given region that have a population strictly greater than 10,000. 
To do this, you write a program that first reads the number of cities in a region as an integer, and then the populations for each city one by one (also integers).

Example
Input
6
1000
5000
15000
4780
0
23590
Output
2

source code:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    int city = 0;
    int population = 0;
    int count = 0;
    int i;
    scanf("%d\n", &city);
    for(i = 0; i < city; i++){
            scanf("%d\n", &population);
            if(population > 10000){
                count = count + 1;
            }
        }
    printf("%d", count);
    return 0;
}

official code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    int nbCities;
    scanf("%d", &nbCities);
    int nbBigCities = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nbCities ; i++)
    {
        int population;
        scanf("%d", &population);
        if(population > 10 * 1000)
        {
            nbBigCities = nbBigCities + 1;
        }
    }
    printf("%d", nbBigCities);
    return 0;
}

Unit 2.2

Question:
Your grandparents gave you a fantastic cooking recipe but you can never remember how much of each ingredient you have to use! 
There are 10 ingredients in the recipe and the quantities needed for each of them are given as input (in grams).
Your program must read 10 integers (the quantities needed for each of the ingredients, in order) and store them in an array.
It should then read an integer which represents an ingredient's ID number (between 0 and 9), and output the corresponding quantity.

Example
Input:
500 180 650 25 666 42 421 1 370 211
3
Output:
25

source code:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int ingredients = 0;
    int array[10];
    int ID = 0;
    int i = 0;
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        scanf("%d", &ingredients);
        array[ID] = ingredients;
        ID = ID + 1;
    }
    scanf("%d", &ID);
    printf("%d", array[ID]);
    return 0;
}



official code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int array[10];
    int readValue = 0;
    int index = 0; //indice 

    for(int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++){
        scanf("%d", &readValue);
        array[index] = readValue;
        index = index + 1;
    }

    scanf("%d", &readValue);
    printf("%d", array[readValue]);
    return 0;
}
